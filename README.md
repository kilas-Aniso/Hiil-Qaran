# About Hiil Qaran
Hiil Qaran is a passion-driven project aimed at preserving and celebrating Somalia's rich cultural heritage, with a special focus on its extraordinary literature and poetry. As the founder of this initiative, I am deeply concerned about the gradual fading of our cherished artistic language, which npmhas played a significant role in shaping Somali identity and history.

Witnessing the diminishing connection of people with our cultural heritage has sparked a strong sense of purpose within me. To address this concern, I embarked on a mission to create Hiil Qaranâ€”a platform that seeks to revive and rekindle the appreciation for Somali literature and poetry among our global community.

Collaborating wholeheartedly with Other software developers, Maureen Ougo and Diana Owiti, Hiil Qaran has now evolved into a collective endeavor. Together, we are dedicated to curating, promoting, and showcasing the exceptional works of Somali authors and poets. Our goal is to empower the Somali community worldwide to rediscover their cultural identity and heritage.
